# Pokémon TCG Market Price Searcher
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Additionally, the React-Bootstrap library was used for the UI. 
## Description
Uses Pokémon TCG API to receive data of the Pokémon cards after the user has input a Pokémon's name. Allows users to enter in any Pokémon name and it will return all the Pokémon cards in the Pokémon TCG with that name. It also provides what set each card was released in and the market prices for the cards depending on its rarities.
